            Code of Ethics: <br>
            1. Do your best to always tell the truth. <br>
            2. Follow the scout oath. <br>
            3. Be willing to do something for anyone if they ask me to. As long as it's outside of their ability and I don't feel like they're using me. <br>
            4. Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you. <br>
            5. When life gets boring, look at things from a different perspective. The same goes if I'm not the person I want to be. <br>
            6. I feel like it's best to stay out of other people's problems, because in the past i feel like some people have become reliant on me for doing so. <br>
            7. I do my best to enable and to teach others when possible and acceptable. <br>
